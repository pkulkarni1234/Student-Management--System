<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">The current manual methods of managing student information in educational institutions lead to inefficiencies, errors, and communication gaps. To address these challenges, there is a need for a Student Management System (SMS) that automates enrollment, attendance tracking, grading, and communication. The SMS should ensure data accuracy, facilitate seamless communication among stakeholders, automate attendance tracking and grading, simplify course registration and scheduling, enhance security and privacy, provide a user-friendly interface, and offer robust reporting and analytics for informed decision-making. The goal is to streamline administrative processes, improve accuracy, and enhance the overall learning experience for students.</p>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p align="justify">
The Student Management System (SMS) project is a centralized software solution that automates administrative tasks within educational institutions. It includes features such as user authentication, student information management, automated attendance tracking, grading system, course registration, communication platform, robust security measures, user-friendly interfaces, reporting tools, and scalability. The SMS aims to streamline processes, enhance accuracy, and improve communication, ultimately providing a more efficient and organized academic environment for students, teachers, and administrators.</p><br>
<b>Key Features :</b>
<ul>
    <li>ChatBot Support</li>
    <li>User-Friendly Interface</li>
